# Kanban Task Manager

A Kanban board is an easy-to-use agile project management tool using the Kanban methodology that helps you to visualize and manage workflows. It can be physical or digital and features columns representing stages of a process. Cards are used to track individual tasks and activities as they progress through the stages.

## Overview

This project uses the STAR approach. Read more about the Kanban methodology in the following articles

- [Kanban](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)>)
- [Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For component composition and styles
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - For utility classes

### The challenge (Situation)

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if not building a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

### Expected Behaviour (Tasks)

- Boards
  - Clicking different boards in the sidebar will change to the selected board.
  - Clicking "Create New Board" in the sidebar opens the "Add New Board" modal.
  - Clicking in the dropdown menu "Edit Board" opens up the "Edit Board" modal where details can be changed.
  - Columns are added and removed for the Add/Edit Board modals.
  - Deleting a board deletes all columns and tasks and requires confirmation.
- Columns
  - A board needs at least one column before tasks can be added. If no columns exist, the "Add New Task" button in the header is disabled.
  - Clicking "Add New Column" opens the "Edit Board" modal where columns are added.
- Tasks
  - Adding a new task adds it to the bottom of the relevant column.
  - Updating a task's status will move the task to the relevant column. If taking on the drag and drop bonus, dragging a task to a different column will also update the status.

### Steps (Action)

1. Configure repository to publish code to a web address.
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. This step is crucial to help plan ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure content with HTML.
4. Write out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section if the current section is completed.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of the major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples is a great way to reinforce knowledge.

**Code Snippets Examples**:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```ts
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
