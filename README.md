# Kanban Task Manager (In Progress)

The Kanban board is an easy-to-use agile project management tool using the Kanban methodology that helps you to visualize and manage workflows. It can be physical or digital and features columns representing stages of a process. Cards are used to track individual tasks and activities as they progress through the stages.

### Expected Behaviour (Tasks)

- Boards
  - Clicking different boards in the sidebar will change to the selected board.
  - Clicking "Create New Board" in the sidebar opens the "Add New Board" modal.
  - Clicking in the dropdown menu "Edit Board" opens up the "Edit Board" modal where details can be changed.
  - Columns are added and removed for the Add/Edit Board modals.
  - Deleting a board deletes all columns and tasks and requires confirmation.
- Columns
  - A board needs at least one column before tasks can be added. If no columns exist, the "Add New Task" button in the header is disabled.
  - Clicking "Add New Column" opens the "Edit Board" modal where columns are added.
- Tasks
  - Adding a new task adds it to the bottom of the relevant column.
  - Updating a task's status will move the task to the relevant column. If taking on the drag and drop bonus, dragging a task to a different column will also update the status.
